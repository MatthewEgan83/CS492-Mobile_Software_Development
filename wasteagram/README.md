# wasteagram

A Flutter project.

## Project Description

This project is a model of a mobile application for a coffee shop where employees can document food wasted at the end of the day.
This is accomplished with "posts" containing photos taken of the items, the number of leftover items, the date the photo was taken,
and the location of the device when the post was created. The application also displays a list of all previous posts that have been created. 

To view a simulation of the application on an emulator, play the mp4 file located in the directory.
